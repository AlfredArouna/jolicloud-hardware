jolicloud-hardware (1.1.1~4) robby-lucid; urgency=low

  * Jolicloud-hardware should only start on starting-dm event. This
    event is emitted by ubiquity, oem-config, and slim, ensuring that
    jolicloud-hardware has had a chance to run prior to any X display,
    regardless of who started X.
  * Create a config-xorg-vboxguest.py script to set 1024x600 as default
    display resolution.
